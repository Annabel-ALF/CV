    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Singing.</strong> I sing in a choir called Some Voices. Also contributing to the creative committee, where we plan shows, design and make the sets at venues such as Troxy, Clapham Grand, Printworks & the Copper Box Arena.</li>
        <li><strong>Dancing.</strong> I used to dance semi-professionally and teach Hip Hop to 10 to 25 year olds. These days I tend to keep my moves to the confines of my living room or when I'm out with friends at gigs or festivals.</li>
        <li><strong>Running.</strong> I like to run competitively and can be found training most mornings in Bushy Park.</li>
      </ul>
